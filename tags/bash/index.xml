      <description>Assymetric encryption is useful if you want to encrypt data at remote server via script. In case you use bash script for symmetric encryption job, you have to store password inside this script. So, if remote server is compromized, you will loose both the encrypted data and the key to decrypt it. Assymetric encryption allows you not to store decryption key at remote machine. So, data will be in safe even if server is hacked.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d like to show how to use HPC part written on C++ with CUDA in Python code. So, every heavy part may be done on GPU with CUDA, all gluing tasks (with beautiful matplotlib plots) are done on CPU with Python.
We will use shared object, compiled from C++ CUDA code in Python. The only uncertain part here is conversation of types from «high-level» Python ones to «low-level» C++ ones. We will write application for parallel calculation of elementwise sum for two arrays.</description>

      <description>You can record your screen using only command line in Linux. Workflow will look like: Create a bunch of screenshots -&amp;gt; Crop screenshots -&amp;gt; Make a movie from images.
§&amp;nbsp;Making screenshots scrot is command line screen capturing tool. It’s basic usage is very simple:
$ scrot or
$ scrot &amp;lt;filename&amp;gt;.png if you want to specify output filename.
Let’s write script, which captures screen every 0.5 seconds and write result to screenshots/00000N.</description>

      <description>Pcap files are pocket capture files. They usually contain raw log of network connections and packets. It is the most popular format and it available in almost all network analysis tool.
To play around *.pcap, you have to get such file somehow. There are two opposite ways: to generate it by yourself or to pick a ready one. To generate it by yourself, you can use wireshark or tcpdump in terminal:</description>

      <title>Show N biggest directories in linux bash</title>

      <description>du (disk usage) utility in linux bash summarizes disk usage of each directory or file. By default, it outputs only directories. Just enter some dir and type
$ du ./ But if ./ has many subdirectories, output will be too long. And it is unsorted. The stated in the title task can be achieved by piping.
§&amp;nbsp;Sort output by size Cut the first line, it is size of the ./ dir as sum of other sizes Use &amp;ldquo;—human-readable&amp;rdquo; in du or divide by 1024 to get kbytes, mbytes, etc.</description>

      <title>Toggling string case in linux bash</title>

      <description>It’s quite an academic task, but anyway useful sometimes. I’ve collected different ways to do it in terminal in linux. Some of them work with UTF-8 characters (some it will toggle case for &amp;ldquo;й&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;ё&amp;rdquo; and so on. It will not in general handle special ligatures, such as &amp;ldquo;ß&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot; and &amp;ldquo;ﬁ&amp;rdquo;.)
Ways are: sed, perl, python, awk, tr, bash, dd.
§&amp;nbsp;Using sed Works with UTF-8 characters.
It is quite straightforward and allows to add custom rules easily.</description>
